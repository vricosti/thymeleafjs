# ThymeleafJS 

ThymeleafJs is a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for client-side HTML template rendering, inspired by Thymeleaf. 
It can be used both in the browser and in Node.js.
This library is perfect for those who are looking for a simple (8kB) yet powerful way to manipulate and render HTML templates using JavaScript.  
ThymeleafJs was generated with the help of ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI (and its servitor to guide it).

## Features

- Client-side rendering support
- Easy-to-use syntax inspired by Thymeleaf
- Conditional rendering and iteration support
- Customizable attribute expressions and processing
- Seamless integration with popular JavaScript frameworks

## Installation

For the moment there is no npm package, you have to build the library and copy it inside your project:  

`npm run build:prod`

## Usage  

### 1. Include ThymeleafJs in your HTML file

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
